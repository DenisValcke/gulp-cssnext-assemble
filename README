** Requires node.js version 6.0.0 and up **

This is a Gulp set-up with the following features:
- PostCSS/CSSNext
- Javascript merge & uglify
- Assemble with Handlebars templates
- Browsersync

Note that it is favorable to have the following folder structure in order for everything to compile in a good manner.
-project-folder
  - app
    - assets
      - fonts
      - img
    - css
      main.css (with imports)
      - subfolder
        - partial.css
        - ...
      - other subfolders
    - js
      - main.js
      - vendors
        - some-vendor-file.js
        - ...
    - templates
      - layouts
        - some-layout.hbs
        - ...
      - partials
        - some-partial.hbs
        - ...
    - index.hbs
    - ...
  - Gulpfile.js
  - package.json

===

If you then move to the project folder in terminal and run 'gulp', everything will compile into a dist folder like so:
- dist
  - app
    - assets
      - fonts
      - img
    - css
      - main.css
    - js
      - main.js
      - vendor.jss
    - index.html
    - ...

===
===

Browsersync will then run from the app in the distfolder and every change made will result in a recompile & refresh of the browser.

Note that if the homepage of your project is not called 'index.html', you need to change the following setting in the browsersync task in the Gulpfile:
>> index: 'your-initial-page.html'
